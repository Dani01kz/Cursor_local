4. Connection Between Chapters and Research Objectives
======================================================================
Research Goal:
To develop and experimentally validate a multiclass machine learning model for
detecting destructive web content in social networks and instant messengers,
with improved classification quality and practical applicability.

Research Objectives:
O1. Analyze the domain and define destructive content classes.
O2. Review and compare existing machine learning approaches.
O3. Formulate the multiclass problem and select methods and tools.
O4. Develop the model, training algorithm, and system architecture.
O5. Conduct experiments and evaluate results against baselines/analogues.
O6. Generalize findings and formulate conclusions and recommendations.

Objective-to-Structure Mapping:
- O1 -> Chapter 1 (1.1, 1.3): domain analysis and taxonomy definition.
- O2 -> Chapter 1 (1.2, 1.3): method review and comparative gap analysis.
- O3 -> Chapter 2 (2.1, 2.2): formalization, metrics, and methodology choice.
- O4 -> Chapter 2 (2.3, 2.4): model design, algorithm, and architecture.
- O5 -> Chapter 3 (3.1-3.5): experiment design, results, and benchmarking.
- O6 -> Conclusion + chapter conclusions: synthesis and recommendations.

7. Logical Model of the Thesis Structure
======================================================================
Scientific problem
  -> Goal of research
    -> Objectives (O1..O6)
      -> Chapters and sections (Introduction, Ch1, Ch2, Ch3, Conclusion)
        -> Methods (review, modeling, experiments, statistics)
          -> Results (metrics, comparisons, analyses)
            -> Conclusions and practical recommendations

Expanded logical chain for this topic:
Problem of destructive content moderation in digital communication
  -> Need for multiclass machine learning detection model
    -> Domain analysis + method review + formalization
      -> Model and architecture development
        -> Experimental validation against baselines/analogues
          -> Scientifically justified conclusions and implementation guidance

======================================================================
8. Typical Mistakes and How This Structure Avoids Them
======================================================================
1) Lack of connection between objectives and chapters:
   - Solved by explicit O1..O6 mapping to specific sections.
2) Overly general chapter/section titles:
   - Solved by topic-specific titles (taxonomy, imbalance handling, ablation).
3) Inconsistency between theoretical and practical parts:
   - Solved by bridge from Chapter 1 gaps to Chapter 2 model design decisions.
4) Duplication of content:
   - Solved by clear role separation: theory (Ch1), development (Ch2),
     validation (Ch3), synthesis (Conclusion).

======================================================================
Final Note
======================================================================
The proposed thesis structure is logically coherent and methodologically aligned
with the research topic "Creating a multiclass model for detecting destructive
web content in social networks and instant messengers using machine learning".
It ensures traceability from scientific problem to validated practical results.
